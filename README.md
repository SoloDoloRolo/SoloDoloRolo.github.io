# SoloDoloRolo.github.io

this is a website. the website is in progress as I am getting annihilated with coursework/projects/student org stuff. love solo <3

this uses basic html, css, and javascript overall

I wanted to keep this super simple as I feel like we see super complex websites everyday and less can be better at times
